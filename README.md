# Checkers V1

## The what?

A basic 1v1 Checkers/ English Draughs game played in the console. An amazing learning experience. 

## The why?

To learn more about Java and get used to making larger more complex programs (this is easily the biggest and most complex thing i've made, sadly :D

## Still to do

Have not yet implemented the win/ loss condition "has no legal moves"
